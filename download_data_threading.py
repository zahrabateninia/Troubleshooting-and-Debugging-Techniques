# Explanations:
# ThreadPoolExecutor = Thread + Pool + Executor.

# Thread is just a train of thought. 
# The Pool portion is where it starts to get interesting. This object is going to create a pool of threads, each of which can run concurrently. 
# Finally, the Executor is the part thatâ€™s going to control how and when each of the threads in the pool will run. It will execute the request in the pool.
